        <p>My grandmother's hamburger casserole is classic comfort food! Featuring ground beef, noodles, and a creamy cheese sauce, this simple recipe dates back to the 1940's. You can tweak the amount of cheese and sour cream depending on what you've got in the fridge — it'll still turn out great!</p>

            </li>
            <li>Cheddar cheese: Shredded Cheddar cheese is sprinkled on top of the casserole to create a decadent finish. You could also use shredded Monterey Jack to turn the heat up a notch.</li>
