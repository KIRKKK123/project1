        <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/H8xFJUBp212Ll7OyNY8SqSD8ehM=/0x512/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/8421847-Million-Dollar-Mac-and-Cheese-Casserole-4x3-137-f447e6c8673b48bfaeb1f89c98239f5c.jpg" alt="Ready to Eat Macaroni and cheese from the oven">
        <p>The team worked backwards to tackle this cooking conundrum, and the result is a mac and cheese our recipe developer called “decadent, dangerously addictive mac and cheese.” Another tester wrote, “I think this is the best mac and cheese I’ve ever had (said upon coming back for seconds),“ so I think we nailed it.

        <h3>Happy Kitchen Tips</h3>
        <p>
            Before we start! you should first Know that this recipe calls for four different types of Cheeses.Now we make the cheese sauce yummy! 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Warming the milk and half-and-half before adding them to the roux help prevent lumps in the béchamel base.</li>
            <li>Dijon mustard serves to add a balancing acidic pop to balance out all the richness of the mac and cheese. You can also swap in mustard powder if that's all you have.</li>
            <li>You can find smoked yellow Cheddar at the deli counter of your local grocery store.</li>
            <li>It’s important to buy block cheeses and freshly shred them yourself on the big holes of a box grater (or using a food processor attachment). Pre-shredded cheeses often have additives that can prevent them from melting properly. 
            </li>
            <li>When making your cheese sauce, gradually add the cheese off the heat. This makes for smoother incorporation and the silkiest sauce possible. It helps to let your cheese come to room temperature a bit beforehand for easier incorporation.
    
            </li>
            <li>If you're short on time, you can skip over toasting the cracker crumbs. Simple stir together your crumbs and sprinkle them over the top of the casserole before baking; the crackers will still add some crunch, although they will be paler.
