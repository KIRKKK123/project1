        <p>Moms are great people. They nurture and guide us as we grow and age, teaching us important life skills along the way. If you’re one of the lucky kids, your mom also filled your belly with delicious, nourishing food and taught you the ways of the kitchen.

        <h3>Tips for Making Stanley Tucci's Mom's Chicken Cacciatore</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Buy chicken parts:</b> If you don’t want to break down a chicken into pieces, buy the parts separately. Many grocery stores will sell bone-in pieces, so buy what you prefer or what your diners will enjoy and use those.
            </li>
            <li><b>Cut the vegetables as instructed:</b> Those big wedges of bell pepper and thick slices of mushroom are the perfect size for this saucy dish. Keeping them big ensures they don’t turn to mush while cooking and makes them easier to eat and enjoy.</li>
            <li><b>Use a good wine:</b> You’ve likely heard this tip, but don’t ignore it. Choose a wine that you would actually drink. A bad wine is bad. Don’t use it for cooking.</li>
            <li><b>Finish it strong:</b> While I loved the dish as written, I also wanted some grated Parmesan and some fresh herbs for finishing. The addition of both rounded out the dish and made it even better.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
           <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste </li>
           <li>½ cup butter</li>
           <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>

        </ul>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously inside and out with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Place 3 tablespoons of butter in chicken cavity; arrange dollops of remaining butter on the outside of chicken. Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; place in the chicken cavity.</li>
            <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest for about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
